  It was like love at first site. Once getting Lucy's massage, that's it! No one
  else out there. I've been her client for more than 5 years. Lucy is a first
  class healthcare provider with deep knowledge of the human body and extensive
  experience to catch any problems just by touching her patients. She is also an
  excellent communicator, finding out the cause of problems and explain about
  her therapy and patients' needs through professional and personable
  conversations. In addition, Lucy never stops working to improve her skills and
  to bring the best to her clients. I would never dream of going to anyone else
  for the massage.

      Lucy has the rare combination of applying appropriate pressures with great
      fidelity in her treatments. One treatment and I was a convert. I see no
      other therapists, now.

      For over two years Lucy has been on the front lines of my healthcare team.
      It can be very difficult to find an RMT that is as professional and
      knowledgeable in the field or passionate and dedicated to helping clients
      as Lucy. She is amazing at getting deep into the muscles to release some
      of my serious knots but also at educating about certain exercises or
      release techniques to help in between appointments. Whether suffering from
      neck pain from long hours on the computer or a bad sleep, lower back pain
      from slips on the ice, or being misaligned after a broken ankle, she has
      always helped me to get back to feeling 100%. Her outgoing, energetic and
      positive attitude, along with her commitment to my well-being has made
      Lucy invaluable and a sheer pleasure to have around. She is by far the
      best RMT I've come across and I pray she will always be available to put
      me back together when I fall out of joint.

      I have struggled for years to correct my posture through weight training,
      stretching, and constant conscious attention to my posture. I went to Lucy
      just for a relaxing massage, and I was flabbergasted to find that she had
      released so much tension from my shoulders and neck that I could stand
      straight and tall with very little effort -pulling my shoulders back
      without having to fight my body.


      I will be going back to Lucy, without a doubt. I was skeptical about how
      much massage could benefit me, particularly since other massages have not
      done what Lucy was able to do. Just one visit, quite literally, improved
      my quality of life. I recommend her services without reservation (She's
      also very friendly, which is a bonus.)
