  **Initial Assessment**


  I will ask you a series of questions pertaining to your health history and
  will assess your posture and identify weakness and will suggest ways improve
  your current condition.




  **Swedish Massage**


  This is a light to moderate approach, therefore, the focus is on relaxation,
  improving circulation and giving you a boost of energy. Swedish massage can
  also aid after injury.




  **Neuromuscular Therapy**


  If you suffer from Chronic pain, nerve compression or postural issues, this
  form of massage manipulates soft tissue involving muscular and the nervous
  system.




  **Deep Tissue**


  This is more therapeutic and will focus on your stiff muscle pain and joints.
  The approach is deeper and slower and will focus on locating those trigger
  points and contracture muscle areas. Over time, those areas become stagnant
  and through the help of deep tissue massage, we are able to release and
  improve blood flow.




  **Sports Massage**


  Some injuries may occur due to a sport or in some sort of training. This
  approach focuses on pre and post events, both with different results. Sports
  Massage can also promote flexibility and help to prevent injury.




  **Pregnancy Massage**


  Your body will go through many changes so depending on what stage you are in
  (pre or post), pregnancy massage can help with reducing pain, improving
  circulation, reducing edema in the legs and feet.
