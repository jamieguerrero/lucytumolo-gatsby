I have struggled for years to correct my posture through weight training, stretching, and constant conscious attention to my posture. I went to Lucy just for a relaxing massage, and I was flabbergasted to find that she had released so much tension from my shoulders and neck that I could stand straight and tall with very little effort -pulling my shoulders back without having to fight my body.

I will be going back to Lucy, without a doubt. I was skeptical about how much massage could benefit me, particularly since other massages have not done what Lucy was able to do. Just one visit, quite literally, improved my quality of life. I recommend her services without reservation (She's also very friendly, which is a bonus.)
