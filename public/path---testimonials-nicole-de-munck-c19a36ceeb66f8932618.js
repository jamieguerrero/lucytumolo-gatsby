It can be very difficult to find an RMT that is as professional and knowledgeable in the field or passionate and dedicated to helping clients as Lucy. She is amazing at getting deep into the muscles to release some of my serious knots but also at educating about certain exercises or release techniques to help in between appointments. Whether suffering from neck pain from long hours on the computer or a bad sleep, lower back pain from slips on the ice, or being misaligned after a broken ankle, she has always helped me to get back to feeling 100%. Her outgoing, energetic and positive attitude, along with her commitment to my well-being has made Lucy invaluable and a sheer pleasure to have around. She is by far the best RMT I've come across and I pray she will always be available to put me back together when I fall out of joint.</p>\n<p><strong>Nicole De Munck</strong><br>\nToronto, ON</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Nicole De Munck"}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/jamie/Documents/workspace/lucytumolo-gatsby/src/pages/testimonials/nicole-de-munck.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
